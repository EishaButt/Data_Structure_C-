#data structures programs 
A Queue is a linear structure which follows particular order in which the operations are performed.
The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. 
The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.

#Queue using Stacks

// CPP program to implement Queue using
// two stacks with costly enQueue()
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct Queue {
	stack<int> s1, s2;

	void enQueue(int x)
	{
		// Move all elements from s1 to s2
		while (!s1.empty()) {
			s2.push(s1.top());
			s1.pop();
		}

		// Push item into s1
		s1.push(x);

		// Push everything back to s1
		while (!s2.empty()) {
			s1.push(s2.top());
			s2.pop();
		}
	}

	// Dequeue an item from the queue
	int deQueue()
	{
		// if first stack is empty
		if (s1.empty()) {
			cout << "Q is Empty";
			exit(0);
		}

		// Return top of s1
		int x = s1.top();
		s1.pop();
		return x;
	}
};

// Driver code section
int main()
{
	Queue q;
	q.enQueue(1);
	q.enQueue(2);
	q.enQueue(3);

	cout << q.deQueue() << '\n';
	cout << q.deQueue() << '\n';
	cout << q.deQueue() << '\n';

	return 0;
}
